# Product Complaint Management App

This is a classy weather app where users can find the temperature of any city or country. The user can find the temperature for the next seven days including today. I was following Jonas Schmedtmann's project based on the class component. I converted that class component into a functional component.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Vite with react
- Functional Component
- States and Props
- useState
- Controlled components
- Fetching
- Async and Await
- Error handling
- useEffec
- Local Storage

### What I learned

Here, I learned more about fetching data from the outside world using useEffect and applying async and await functionality to achieve asynchronous programming. I learned about controlled components and how we can convert uncontrolled components to controlled ones. A new concept was introduced here, which I have learned, and that is local storage. I store the user's city or country temperature in local storage, and on refresh, the temperature for that city or country will still be there on a new load.
